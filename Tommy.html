<p> I, Jake Buckman, have a lot of hobbies I do in my lifetime. I play a lot soccer in my life. I have practices three times a week, and most of the time a game on the weekends. I play for the Quakes soccer club in Central Valley. I have been playing since I was four or five years old. I am playing on a competitive team currently after playing recreational for four years. Another hobby I have is listenng to music. I listen to all kinds of music by every kind of artist or band. My favorite song is My Huse by Flo Rida. Whenever I have to work on homework or do a job such as chores, I would plug my earbuds in and listen my music. Another hobby is hanging out with friends. I have a lot of frineds and we do a lot together such as go to the pool, the beach, the movies, jump onmy trampoline, and play sports.</p>
