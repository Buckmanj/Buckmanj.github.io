<p>My name is Jake Grant Buckman. I live with one sister, one brother, a mom, a dad, and two dogs. My dads name is Grant, my moms name is Jenna, my brothers name is Logan, my sisters name is Brooke, and the two dogs names are Indy and Ripley. I was born in Washington Hospital in Fremont, California on January 11th, 2003. I am 13 years old. I am in 8th grade at Ida Price Middle School. I moved to San Jose when I was one years old. I went to ATLC for my preschool and Bagby as my elementary school. And now Ida Price for my middle school. I made a lot of friends thoughout these years. My best childhood friends are Tommy, Nick, Michael, and Marco. I am still friends with these people today. I have  a few different fears that really scare me good. The biggest fear is bees, the second biggest is bugs, and the third biggest fear is heights. I didn't have all these heights when I was really little. The bee fear grew on my wheni grew older. The heights fear was ever since I was born.
