<p>I have many interests/passions in a variety of many different things. I love dogs. I have two dogs that I just absolutely love. I love to play with the dogs and just hang out with them overall. Another interest I have is sunglasses. One thing about me is that I loike to look good whever I can. The sunglasses make me look cool in my opinion. One passion I have is soccer teams. My favorite soccer team is The San Jose Quakes. My favorite soccer player is, if I had to pick one, Christiano Ronaldo. He is really good with his foot work and just an overall amzing soccer player. One interest I also have is pasta. I love many types of pasta. That is one reason why it's my favorite food or interest. You can create many different styles of pasta.
